# Simple-Mandelbrot

Python Code to compute and generate images for the Mandelbrot set given user input variables. Used Matplotlib and Numpy packages.

Yes this could be optimized but the point for this is to be easily replicated so anyone to pick up, understand easily and play with. Optimised versions will be added.
